# StravaES

## Strava Enhancement Suite
The Strava Enhancement Suite toggles the visible units between metric and imperial without having to change your account settings. Click on the StravaES icon in the address bar, or use the keyboard shortcut to toggle.

Note: StravaES only works on the dashboard and when viewing an individual activity. We are working to make it avalable on all parts of the site.

Keyboard shortcut: &#x2325;&#x21E7;T (or Alt-Shift-T)

## Installation 
To install, clone or download a zip of the StravaES folder. In Chrome Extensions, check the "Developer Mode" box, then click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the folder.
